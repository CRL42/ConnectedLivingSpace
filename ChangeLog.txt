1.2.5.5
	Updated CLSB9.cfg:
	Thanks to @Mine_Turtle:
		I have added CDP docking port(supposed to be used with s2 parts) to the
		list and made s2 crew parts passable, when surface attached. Reason: there
		is no inline s2 docking adapter, nor it is possible to attach stock
		docking ports to s2 modules and have crew transfers with CLS.
