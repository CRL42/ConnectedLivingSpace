Connected Living Space v1.2.0.9
---------------------------

To install copy the GameData folder to your KSP folder. Module Manager is required to load the configuration.

If you are integrating a mod with CLS then the contents of the dev directory has all you will need - an assembly that defines the interfaces, and a suggested snippet of code for testing for and accessing CLS.
